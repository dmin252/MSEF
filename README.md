## Thermal Simulation: Hypocaust vs Modern Heating



### Overview
This project presents a comprehensive thermal simulation comparing two heating systems: the ancient Roman hypocaust and modern heating solutions. Utilizing Streamlit, this interactive application allows users to input various parameters, visualize data, and analyze the efficiency and environmental impacts of both systems.



### How to use simulator
1)`Open Simulation` [Click](https://thermal-dynamics-visualizer-msef.replit.app/)

2)`Input Parameters` Use the sidebar to enter room dimensions, select materials for both systems, and configure the energy source.

3)`Run Simulation` Click the "Run Simulation" button to initiate the analysis.

4)`View Results` Explore the generated visualizations and comparative data displayed on the main page.





### Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** For building the web application interface.

- **NumPy:** For numerical calculations and data handling

- **Plotly:** For creating interactive visualizations.

- **Custom Modules:**  Includes `ThermalSimulation`, `HeatingVisualizer`, `MaterialDatabase`, and `SystemEquivalency` for specialized functionalities.

### Features

- `User-Friendly Interface` Designed with a sidebar for easy parameter input, including room dimensions, material properties, and energy source configuration.
- `Dynamic Visualizations` Generates 2D heat maps, 3D temperature distributions, and system diagrams to illustrate heat flow and efficiency.
- `Comparative Analysis` Provides detailed comparisons of operational emissions, embodied carbon, maintenance impacts, and overall environmental effects.
- `Scientific Justification` Offers explanations of the scientific principles behind the heating systems and their performances.
